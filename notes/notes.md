<https://github.com/settings/tokens/new>

1. **Create Personal Access Token**
   * Go to GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
   * Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   * Note/Name: `MKDOCS_MATERIAL_INSIDERS`
   * Select scopes:
     * `repo` (full control)
   * Generate token and copy it

2. **Add Secret to Repository**
   * Go to repository Settings <https://github.com/shaneholloman/mkdocs-material-example/settings/secrets/actions>
   * Navigate to Security → Secrets and variables → Actions
   * Click "New repository secret"
   * Name: `GH_TOKEN`
   * Value: *paste your PAT*
   * Click "Add secret"

3. **Verify Workflow Access**
   * The workflow already references the secret correctly:

    ```yaml
    env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    ```
